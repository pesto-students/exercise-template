## Adding `.env` file

If you are getting the warning of _Too Many Requests_ from GitHub, then
you can add an `.env` file in the root directory with your GITHUB api key.
You can refer to this [link](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to generate your own token.

Here's an example of an `.env` file:

```
GITHUB_API_KEY=here_goes_your_api_key
```

_(Make sure to not commit your `.env`);_

**You do NOT need to check any checkbox in "Select Scopes" section.** The token is just used to extend the rate limit for downloading files from Github.

## Docs

**Please ensure you are in the top-level of the package and not in any subfolders (like `js-exercises`).**

### Fetching a question
You can fetch question using `npm` or `yarn` package manager.

```shell
$ npm run download <question-name>
```
Example: Fetch `cache-function` question

```shell
$ npm run download cache-function
```

```shell
$ yarn run download <question-name>
```

Example: Fetch `flip-args` question

```shell
$ yarn run download flip-args

## Restrictions

- Don't download any extra dependency for solving any question. You can only use internal node modules.
- A solution will not be considered complete until an implementation and a test file are both provided.
  - For example â€” if the question is to code `add` function, then `add.js` should contain the implementation and `add.test.js` should contain the test cases.
  - For some questions, test cases are provided. **For questions where test cases are missing, you need to add them.**
  - Write tests for all the questions using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- For daily exercises the pull request should be created before 5 PM (IST) the next day.
- For long exercises the pull request should be created before 5 PM (IST) on Monday.
- Your homework will not be counted as complete if the pull request is not created within the above time frame.

## Note
- **Do not merge your code in master branch**
- Pull request should contain only solutions to problems given for a day. It should not have any file for other days solution.
- For Every Pull Request, It is mandatory for you to add your cohort members and instructor as reviewer. Cohort member should only be added as reviewer post submission deadline.
